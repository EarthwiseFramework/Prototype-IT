Connectivity Algorithm

Inputs:
	Composition (as 0-1 raster)
	Roads (with a 0-1 Road Threat field)
	Road Threat Multiplier
	Streams
	Stream Benefit Factor
	Cores / Protected Areas (unique identifier for each)
	Study Area (mask)
	Smallest Protected Area (to include in analysis)
	Maximum Protected Area Separation
	Percentage of Corridor Values to Keep
	Permeability Weight
	Corridor Envelope Weight
	LCP Length Weight

Generate Cost Surface from Composition, Road Threat and Stream Benefit
	X = 1 - Composition
	Y = Road Threat X Road Threat Multiplier for Roads (with NoData = 0)
	Z = 1 / Stream Benefit Factor for Streams (with NoData = 1)
	Cost Surface = Z * (X + Y)

Exclude small Protected Areas

For each Protected Area
	Generate separate raster
	Calc Cost Distance with Backlinks

Determine the Distance between each pair of Protected Areas, limiting pairs to those at least as close as the maxProtectedAreaSeparation

For each unique pair of Protected Areas
	Calc Corridor
	Calc Least Cost Path (LCP)
	Estimate LCP Length as LCP Cell Count (potential to improve this)
	Calc Standardized Corridor as Corridor divided by LCP
	Create Corridor Envelope by eliminating higher values from Standardized Corridor using percentageCorridorValuesToKeep
	Extract Corridor cells only within Corridor Envelope
	Calc Impermeability as EXtracted Corridor divided by LCP Length
	In the process, prepare for normalization
		Find minimum and maximum of all Impermeability rasters
		Find minimum and maximum of all LCPLengths

For each unique pair of Protected Areas
	Invert/Normalize Impermeability based on overall min and max (A - permeability from the wildlife perspective is desirable)
	Invert/Normalize Corridor Envelope (B - crucial corridors between core areas need to be considered, even if they have low permeability)
	Invert/Normalize LCP Length based on overall min and max (C - shorter corridors are better than longer corridors of the same permeability)
	Calc Pair Connectivity as Weighted Sum of A, B, C (default weights 0.7, 0.2, 0.1) 

Calc Overall Connectivity as Max of all Pair Connectivity rasters
Normalize the output so the lowest valued cell of the lowest value corridor is 0
