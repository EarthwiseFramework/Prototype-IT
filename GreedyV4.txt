Run Analysis parameter Analysis Type:
- Composition Only
- Composition and Connectivity
- Composition and Contiguity
- Composition, Connectivity and Contiguity
- Greedy Heuristic (includes Composition, Connectivity and Contiguity)

The Greedy Heuristic iteratively selects (recommends) properties. It assumes selected properties are Protected and then recalculates the Composition, Connectivity and Contiguity for each selection iteration/round. Because Connectivity is an order of magnitude slower to run than Composition and Contiguity, it may not be recalculated on every iteration (based on the Recalc Interval parameter).

Size parameters (areas and distances) are in the units of the input Property Feature Class.

Run Analysis parameters for Greedy Heuristic:
- Greedy Target Type (choices Budget, Area, Biodiversity-based Area, Property Count, Biodiversity-based Property Count)
- Greedy Budget Target (only applies to Greedy Target Type = Budget)
- Greedy Area Target (only applies to Greedy Target Type = Area or Biodiversity Based Area)
- Greedy Property Count Target (only applies to Greedy Target Type = PropertyCount or Biodiversity Based Property Count)
- Properties Per Greedy Iteration (number of properties to select per iteration)
- Connectivity Recalc Interval (how often to recaculate Connectivity)
- Minimum Property Size (smallest property to select)

Run Analysis simplified algorithm:

Record model parameters

Make copy of Properties called ScenarioOutputX

Iterate
	Run Composition (includes many sub-components)

	If (AnalysisType includes Connectivity) and (On ConnectivitySkipInterval)
		Run Connectivity

	If AnalysisType includes Contiguity
		Run Contiguity

	If AnalysisType includes Composition, Connectivity and Contiguity
		Run Biodiversity
		Run Acquisition Priority

	If AnalysisType is Greedy Heuristic
		Flag Top PropertiesPerGreedyIteration in ScenarioOutputX as Recommended Acquisition Order Y (integer to indicate recommended order)
		Add "Best" PropertiesPerGreedyIteration to Protected Areas with custom IUCN category
		Flag "Best" PropertiesPerGreedyIteration in Properties so they are excluded from next iteration
		If TotalSpent is > AcquisitionBudget TotalArea > AreaBudget or TotalPropertiesAcquired is > AcquistionCount target
			Stop iterating
	Else
		Stop iterating
